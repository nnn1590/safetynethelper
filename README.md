SafetyNet `attest()` Helper
================

SafetyNet Helper wraps the Google Play Services SafetyNet.API and verifies Safety Net API response with the [Android Device Verification API](https://developer.android.com/google/play/safetynet/start.html#verify-compat-check). The SafetyNet.API analyses the device your app is running on to test its software/hardware configuration matches that of a device that has passed the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS). Note this is a client only validation, it's recommended to include [server side validation]().

*Rooted* devices seem to cause `ctsProfileMatch=false`.

**Recommend reading the developers guide to getting started with [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/google/play/safetynet/start.html)**

Extract from Android [SafetyNet API doc](https://developer.android.com/google/play/safetynet/index.html)

*Check if your app is running on a device that matches a device model that has passed Android compatibility testing. This analysis can help you determine if your app will work as expected on the device where it is installed. The service evaluates both software and hardware characteristics of the device, and may use hardware roots of trust, when available.*

*Since this library release Google has created an [Safety Net Sample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-play-safetynet/tree/master/android/SafetyNetSample)


##Features

* Calls Google play services Safety Net test
* Local verification of request
* Verifies Safety Net API response with the Android Device Verification API (over SSL pinned connection)


## Requires / Dependencies

* Google Play services (specifically the SafetyNet API 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-safetynet:17.0.0')
* Requires Internet permission
* Google API key for the [Android Device Verification API](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html#verify-compat-check)

##Server Validation!!!
This library was built to get app developers up and going with SafetyNet attest API.
With skill and time any device based checks can be bypassed. This is why the validation should be handled by the server. Therefore you should look at implementing more robust and secure validation of the `attest` response via a server-side component.

* App requests the nonce / request token from your server
* Call `SafetyNet.SafetyNetApi.attest(googleApiClient, requestNonce)
* Pass the JWT response from SafetyNet API to your server for validation (the same validation check which this library completes)
	* Check the nonce/request token matches the expected value
	* verify the SafetyNet response is from Google using the Android Device Verification API
	* verify app package, timestamp, apk and certificate digests

If verification fails then at least your server would know if the device (and app installation) was compromised and take appropriate action e.g revoking OAUTH tokens.


## How to use

You'll need to get a **API key** from the Google developer console to allow you to verify with the Android Device Verification API (in the sample project this is set via a BuildConfig field to keep my api key out of GitHub)

```java

    final SafetyNetHelper safetyNetHelper = new SafetyNetHelper(API_KEY);

    safetyNetHelper.requestTest(context, new SafetyNetHelper.SafetyNetWrapperCallback() {
            @Override
            public void error(int errorCode, String msg) {
                //handle and retry depending on errorCode
                Log.e(TAG, msg);
            }

            @Override
            public void success(boolean ctsProfileMatch, boolean basicIntegrity) {
                if (ctsProfileMatch) {
                    //profile of the device running your app matches the profile of a device that has passed Android compatibility testing.
                else if(basicIntegrity){
                    //then the device running your app likely wasn't tampered with, but the device has not necessarily passed Android compatibility testing.
                } else {
                    //handle fail, maybe warn user device is unsupported or in compromised state? (this is up to you!)
                }
            }
        });
```

### Add as dependency

This library is not released in Maven Central, until then you can add as a library module or use [JitPack.io](https://jitpack.io/#scottyab/safetynethelper)


add remote maven url

```gradle

    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://jitpack.io"
        }
    }
```

then add a library dependency

```gradle

    dependencies {
        compile 'com.github.scottyab:safetynethelper:0.8'
    }
```


## Sample App
